##  Features

|    | Feature           | Description                                                                                          |
|----|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | Built with PHP and Docker, follows a monolithic architecture. Uses MySQL for data storage.           |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | Codebase follows PHP and JavaScript best practices. Lacks consistent code formatting and comments.  |
| 📄 | **Documentation** | Limited inline comments. Detailed README.md, but lacks comprehensive documentation for contributors.|
| 🔌 | **Integrations**  | Integrates Docker, Composer, and jQuery for front-end interactivity.                                 |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | Codebase lacks clear separation of concerns. Limited modularity and reusability in the components.   |
| 🧪 | **Testing**       | No mention of testing frameworks or tools. Testing seems to be manual, impacting code reliability.   |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | Efficiency could be improved with code optimizations. Resource usage depends on Docker container settings. |
| 🛡️ | **Security**      | Uses environment variables for MySQL connection. Lacks detailed mentions of other security measures.  |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**  | Key dependencies include PHP, JavaScript, Docker, Composer, MySQL.                                    |
| 🚀 | **Scalability**   | Limited scalability due to monolithic architecture. May face challenges with handling increased traffic. |

**Project Dependencies**: PHP, JavaScript, Docker, Composer, MySQL.

**Repository Contents**:
- `dbconfig.php`: Configures MySQL connection using environment variables.
- `index.php`: Creates an interactive landing page with SVG shapes and embedded links.
- `registrationstudent.php`: Implements a student registration form with validation.
- `jquery.min.js`: Manages web interface and content on the homepage.
- `Dockerfile`, `start.sh`: Set up Docker environment and startup scripts.
